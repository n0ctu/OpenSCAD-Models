# OpenSCAD Models

A collection of parametric 3D / 2D models I sometimes make for DIY projects. Feel free to use them for your projects!

## Usage

Install OpenSCAD using your favourite package manager or download OpenSCAD from the [official website](https://www.openscad.org/downloads.html) to open the `.scad` files in this repository. Take a look at the parameters to customize the models. You can then export the models to STL, SVG or other formats and print/cut them.
